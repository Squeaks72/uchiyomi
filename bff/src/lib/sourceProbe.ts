 * - The search loop tries several terms because a site with few titles can legitimately miss one. It stops on

 *   (Manga Ball paid for four searches of its own exception), and only an empty answer -- or the engine client
 *   giving up on one term (ENGINE_TIMEOUT) -- justifies another term.
 * - Chapters are asked of up to three search hits, not the first: one title with no chapters is a title, not
 *   a broken source.
 * - Pages are asked of the newest chapter first, then the middle and the oldest (pageCandidates).
 * - A chapter list whose every chapter lacks a usable number says so (`unnumbered`), because "none found"
