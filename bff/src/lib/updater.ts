/**
 * Sweep the library for new chapters.
 *
 * Three things this loop did not do, and what each cost on the night it was measured:
 *
 * - It had no budget. The only cap was maxNew per series, so a sweep's ceiling was every series times five.
 * - It walked series in `latest_mtime DESC` order, freshest first. The 54 series furthest behind sorted LAST,
 *   so anything that cut a sweep short starved exactly them, every night.
 * - It walked them in one flat line. 192 of 226 series share one source, and when that source went into a
 *   cooldown 28 series in, the remaining 164 were skipped one after another -- and the 34 series on other
 *   sources behind them in the line never got their turn either.
 *
 * Now: one queue per source, visited round-robin, least-recently-checked first; a source that goes into a
 * cooldown parks its own queue and nobody else's; attempts stop at SWEEP_MAX; a full disk stops everything
 * and says so. Chapters already on disk cost nothing against the budget.

 * well over ten minutes, with `lastResult` still saying whatever the night before had said), wrote nothing
 * to the log when it finished, swallowed a throw with a `.catch(() => {})`, and -- since `runtime.updating`

 * caller has to remember to, and none needs a `.catch(() => {})` again.

 * `sweep` is the seam a test uses to make the sweep itself throw. No fake source can: a source that throws
 * is a per-series `source_error`, which is the sweep working as designed.

 * the same series folders and both write lib_books for what landed, and a chapter the repair is replacing
 * could be the file the sweep is scanning. server.ts's tick re-arms itself ten minutes on; the panel's
 * "Run now" is told a repair is running. The repair refuses to start while `updating` is set, so the two
 * never hold each other's flag at once.
