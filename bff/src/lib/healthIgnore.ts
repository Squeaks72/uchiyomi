// Health findings an admin has chosen to ignore (v0.48.3).
//
// The owner: "there is no button to ignore this warning so it never repeats again". Every check recomputes its
// findings from live data on every run, so a gap nobody will ever fill, a source that is simply slow, a folder
// of someone's own -- each came back on every run, turned the page amber and brought the header's warning back.
//
// An ignored finding is not deleted and not hidden: it stays on its card, greyed, with "Stop ignoring". It stays
// quiet while everything it is about NOW was already part of what was ignored -- a gap that shrinks stays quiet,
// a newly missing chapter makes it a new finding -- and an ignore whose finding has been gone for a week is
// dropped, so a problem that went away and came back is news again. Ignoring means "don't tell me"; it never
// stops the repair from fixing the thing.
//
// Short chapters are not here: their "It's fine" already records exactly this judgement, and the repair reads it.
