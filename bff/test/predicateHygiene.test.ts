// Per-library access is enforced by the same predicate. A 24th copy is not a style problem, it is a viewer
// seeing a library they were not granted, in a route nobody remembered to update. So: one copy, enforced by
// a test, and a new query that needs the rule has to go through visible() to get it.
//
// Pure static check. No database, no environment, runs everywhere.
