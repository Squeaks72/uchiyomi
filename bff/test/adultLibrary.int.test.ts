// A library rated 18+ stays off every browsing surface until it is asked for.
//
// This is a SURFACING filter and not a permission — `max_age_rating` is the permission and has its own
// tests. The rule here is narrower and the owner chose it deliberately: scope is the LIBRARY's own
// `age_rating`, not a series override, and the reveal lasts one browser session.
//
// The test is written as a sweep over every listing endpoint rather than a handful of spot checks, because
// "everywhere" is a completeness claim and the way it fails is that somebody adds a thirteenth rail. A leak
// through `/api/updates` is exactly as bad as one through the library grid, and much easier to miss.
//
// The other half is just as important: hiding must not become an access control. The reader, the chapter
// list, page bytes, the offline manifest, next/previous and reading-progress writes all have to keep
// working while the library is hidden, because the browser session that hides it cannot reach a service
// worker flushing progress with the app closed, an <img> tag, or an OPDS client.
//
// Since v0.42.0 (issue #64) the same rule covers Discover's SOURCES, not just the library's series. The
// chip used to hide 18+ libraries while Discover went on listing every adult provider and painting its
// newest covers -- on the reporting install twelve of fourteen enabled sources are NSFW, so "Show 18+" off
// left a clean library behind a wall of adult covers. The `surfaceable` half of the sweep below is that
// claim: the source list, its two walls, the per-source search, the cross-source search and `/find` all
// honour the chip, while `fill/scan`, `detail` and `add` deliberately do not -- a series whose own source
// is adult must stay fillable. Those listing tests assert on each fake source's own CALL COUNTER as well as
// on the body, because a source that is asked and answers nothing passes a body-only assertion for the
// wrong reason, and being asked at all is an outbound request to an adult site.
