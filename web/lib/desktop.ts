 * Uchiyomi Desktop: the ONE place the web app asks whether it is running inside the desktop app.

 * One web bundle serves both builds, so the answer is decided at run time from two signals:
 *
 *   * the preload marker `window.uchiyomiDesktop`, which only the desktop shell's own window carries
 *     (`desktopShell()`) -- page JavaScript cannot fake it for another window, and a browser tab pointed at
 *     the same port never has it;
 *   * `desktop: true` in an auth answer (`/auth/refresh`, `/auth/desktop`, `/auth/config`), which the server
 *     sends only when its own desktop switch is on (`noteServerDesktop`).
 *
 * `isDesktop()` is either. With both absent -- every Docker install -- each function here answers exactly
 * what the code it replaced answered, so the server build behaves and looks the same byte for byte.
 *
 * ⚠️ Dependency-free on purpose: `lib/api.ts` imports this, and this must never import `api` back.
