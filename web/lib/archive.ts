 * The slow archive (#117) as the web app shows it: the rules, with no React in them.
 *
 * The server keeps a queue of SERIES to be fetched slowly (bff lib/archive.ts), and sends it as the `archive`
 * object of GET /api/sources/jobs -- the one ['source-jobs'] query AppShell already polls, so the archive adds
 * no timer of its own. This file turns that object into what Library -> Downloads draws (`archiveItems`), the
 * words for every state it can be in, the add dialog's "Archive the rest slowly" line, and the outcomes of
 * queueing one series or a Library selection.
 *
 * ⚠️ The archive is NOT a download in progress. It takes a chapter every quarter of an hour or so, for days, so
 * it never turns the Library ring, never counts on it, never makes the poll faster and never puts a cover in
 * Running: its home is Queued, as a cover with a STILL amber ring (lib/serverDownloads.ts holds those rules,
 * each with its own test). The owner's call.
