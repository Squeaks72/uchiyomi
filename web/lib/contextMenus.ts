// Right-click and long-press menus for series and chapters (#100, @Squeaks72's proposal): the pure parts.
//
// Everything a series can have done to it lived on its page, one load away from wherever the series was on
// screen. components/ContextMenu.tsx is one menu, opened four ways -- right-click, a press-and-hold on a
// touchscreen, the row's own ⋯ button, and Shift+F10 / the Menu key -- and every surface contributes its own
// short list of items to it.
//
// Taking the browser's menu away is what annoys exactly the people who use a browser on purpose, so it is
// taken only where there is nothing of the browser's worth keeping: never on selected text, never in a text
// field, never with Shift held (the convention for "give me the real one"), The cards are links, so the menu offers
// the two things the browser's would have: Open in a new tab and Copy link.
