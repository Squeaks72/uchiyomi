/**
 * The reading flow: the list of pages the reader actually walks, and how a repeated page sits in it.
 *
 * This lives outside the reader component for the same reason `readerSpread.ts` and `readerState.ts` do —
 * it is arithmetic that decides what you see, and inside an 800-line component it could only be checked by
 * opening a chapter and counting. Three shipped bugs came from exactly this arithmetic being unreachable:
 * a resume that landed a page late, a chapter divider that disappeared, and a page-grid tile that jumped to
 * the top of the library. All three are now one function with tests.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CENTRAL RULE: a page being skipped is a property of HOW IT RENDERS, not of whether it exists. The
 * flow holds every page in `show` and `collapse` mode; only `hide` removes anything. Filtering was what made
 * "flat index" and "page number" two different things, and every one of those bugs was a place that quietly
 * assumed they were the same.

 * one, NOTHING in the flow carries the flag: the "Up Next / chapter title" divider silently disappears, and
 * because `pairSlides` uses the same flag to keep the first page of a chapter solo, every double-page spread
 * in that chapter shifts by one. Deriving it here makes it true by construction in all three modes.
 * Reintroduce by setting it from the source index instead: in `hide` mode a chapter whose first page is
 * repeated loses its divider and re-phases its spreads.
 *
 * ⚠️ The "never leave a chapter empty" guard is PER CHAPTER. It used to be a single check over the whole
 * list — `out.length ? out : all` — which is a different claim entirely: with two chapters loaded, one of
 * them entirely furniture, the list is non-empty, so that chapter was dropped from the flow completely and
 * continuous reading walked straight past it. Reintroduce by testing the total length instead of each
 * chapter's: a fully-flagged chapter vanishes between its neighbours.
