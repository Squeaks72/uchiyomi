// What one press on the reader's page track means.
//
// Three actions share that one target -- turn the page, toggle the chrome, zoom -- and only timing tells
// them apart. The reader used to do that arithmetic inline with two constants that disagreed: a single tap
// was acted on after 260 ms, while a second tap still counted as a double for 300 ms. Any double-click whose
// two clicks were 260-300 ms apart therefore did BOTH -- the page turned and then the zoom arrived -- and in
// paged mode the turn is what the reader saw: a double-click to zoom walked them a page on, every time, and
// because the page the reader is on drives the progress ping, the stray turn was also written down as
// reading (a turn onto the last page of a chapter marks the chapter finished).
//
// One window governs both here: a tap is acted on only once a second one can no longer arrive. That is the
// whole invariant, and `singleTapDelay` returning TAP_WINDOW_MS is how a test pins it.
//
// A MOUSE is deliberately not double-detected by this module. The interval that decides what counts as a
// double-click belongs to the operating system -- Windows defaults to 500 ms, twice this window -- and a web
// page cannot read it, so competing with it means guessing. The reader hands mouse doubles to the browser's
// own `dblclick`, which knows the real setting, and uses `undoWindow` below to take back a single-click
// action that had already fired by the time it arrived.
