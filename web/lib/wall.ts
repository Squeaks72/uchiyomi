// One card per work on the Discover wall, the way search-all already groups server-side.
//
// The wall is six sources' newest lists flattened in arrival order, and popular titles are on most of
// them, so the same series sat on the wall three or four times under slightly different spellings (issue
// #36). Search never had this problem: `/api/sources/search-all` folds its hits into one card carrying every
// provider. The wall gets the same fold here, in the client, because its rows arrive one source at a time and
// nothing already on screen may move -- so the first source to land a title keeps the card, and later sources
// only join its provider list.
//
// Since v0.56.0 the fold is by WORK rather than by spelling. The server names each row's work -- `lib:` a series the
// library holds, `al:` / `mu:` / `md:` what AniList, MangaUpdates or MangaDex say the name is, `n:` a name it has not
// placed yet -- so two sources that title one series differently make one card once a service says so. And the wall
// hides every work the library holds, in any language: the owner's call, browsing is for what you do not have yet.
// Search keeps those, under its "In library" ribbon. A name the server had not placed when it answered is asked about
// again while the page is open (lib/useLiveWorks.ts); `applyWorks` lays the answers over the rows as they came.
//
// Split out of the page so it can be tested without a browser, like sourceGroups.ts.
