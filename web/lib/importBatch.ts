 * "One Piece" against "One Piece Colored" -- where an app spells the same title with a suffix. It is wrong
 * for three shapes in which a DIFFERENT title contains this one: extra words in front or on both sides
 * ("Naruto" inside "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations"), a "suffix" longer than the title it hangs off
 * ("Berserk" inside "Berserk of Gluttony"), and a short suffix that names a sequel, a season or a novel
 * ("Solo Leveling: Ragnarok", "Tower of God Season 2", "… (Novel)"). The third is the
 * commonest by far: a cross-source `contains` is reached only when that source does NOT carry the plain
 * title (`exact` is tried first), and a source that has the sequel almost always has the original too --
 * so a suffix-only hit is disproportionately the other work. Either title may be the one carrying the
 * suffix (a backup of "Tower of God Season 2" matched to "Tower of God" is the same wrong pick in reverse).
 * Those are the rows that deserve the Needs attention chip: a wrong add is a series a person has to find
 * and remove, a needless glance costs a second. The one thing that must stay calm at any length is an
 * edition qualifier -- "(Official Colored)", "(Full Color)", ": Digital Colored Comics" -- which is what
