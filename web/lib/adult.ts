/**
 * Whether 18+ libraries are showing, for this browser session.
 *
 * A library rated 18+ is kept off every browsing surface by default: the home rails, the library grid,
 * search, browse, collections, updates, history, bookmarks and the OPDS feeds. A button reveals them, and
 * the reveal lasts until the browser session ends.
 *
 * WHY A SESSION COOKIE, and not localStorage or sessionStorage:
 *   - "until you close the browser" is precisely what a cookie with no Max-Age already means, so the
 *     lifetime is the browser's own rather than something this file has to reimplement and get wrong;
 *   - sessionStorage is per-TAB, so two tabs of the same app would disagree with each other, which is
 *     bewildering when one of them is a series page opened from the other;
 *   - localStorage would outlive the session, which is the one thing the setting must not do.
 * It is deliberately not httpOnly: this is a display preference the page itself has to read, not a
 * credential. The server never trusts it for access — see `browsable()` in the API.
 *
 * The server is told by a query parameter rather than by the cookie, and that is not redundancy. The
 * service worker caches `/api/` responses with `networkFirst`, and the Cache API keys by URL with no
 * `Vary`: a cookie leaves a revealed `/api/home` sitting under the same URL as an unrevealed one, ready to
 * be replayed the first time the network hiccups. A different URL is a different cache entry, for free.
