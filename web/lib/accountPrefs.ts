/**
 * Three switches that used to be per-device and are now per-ACCOUNT, stored in the account's settings
 * (`compactChapters`, `showGhosts`, `alsoFollow` in `/api/settings`, bff lib/accountSettings.ts), the way
 * Reduce effects is (lib/effects.ts): someone who turns the compact chapter list on at their desk should not
 * have to find the switch again on every other browser.
 *
 *  - `compactChapters`: the denser chapter list on a computer (off by default; lib/compactChapters.ts);
 *  - `showGhosts`: chapters the sources list that this server lacks, on the series page (ON by default);
 *  - `alsoFollow`: the Add dialog's "also check the other sources" (off by default).
 *
 * localStorage stays as a MIRROR, under the same keys and values these switches always used, for the two starts
 * that cannot ask the server: the first paint and an offline launch. Local wins until the account's value has
 * loaded; the account's value then overwrites it (`adoptAccountPrefs`, called from lib/auth.tsx on every
 * sign-in and refresh, so a switch changed on another device arrives here). An account that holds NO value yet
 * keeps what this device has, and `localOnlyPrefs` says what to upload so the choice is not lost on upgrade.
 * Type-to-search and right-click menus are NOT here: they are about this keyboard and this pointer.
