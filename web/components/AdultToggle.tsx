/**
 * Reveal libraries rated 18+, for this browser session.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all unless this account actually holds an 18+ library, because for almost every
 * install it is a control with nothing behind it. `/api/libraries` reports `adult` for exactly this, and it
 * already drops libraries above the viewer's age cap — so an account that may not open the 18+ shelf never
 * sees the button that would reveal it.
 *
 * `alsoWhen` is a second reason to render, for a screen that knows of something else the reveal is hiding.
 * Discover passes `hiddenAdult > 0` from `/api/sources`: since v0.42.0 the reveal also hides adult
 * PROVIDERS, and an install with adult sources and no 18+ library would otherwise lose them with no button
 * anywhere to ask for them back. It only ever adds a reason; the library check alone still renders it.
 *
 * Flipping it invalidates every query rather than a chosen list. The reveal changes what a dozen endpoints
 * return — the home rails, search, genres and their counts, collections, updates, history, bookmarks, and
 * now the Discover source list — and enumerating them here would be one more list to forget to update.
