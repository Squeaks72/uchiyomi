/**
 * Ninety days of reading, drawn as the floor of the profile hero.
 *
 * The point of stretching it across the whole width rather than boxing it in a card is that at 1856px each
 * bar is 19px and the thing becomes a readable timeline; the 318px card it replaces could only ever be a
 * decoration. The last seven days burn at full accent and the eighty-three behind them at 42%, so "am I
 * still reading" is answered by brightness before any number is read.
 *
 * `days` arrives dense from `/api/stats` -- the BFF builds it with `generate_series`, one UTC row per day,
 * zeroes included. There is deliberately no client-side gap filling here: a second implementation of the
 * calendar would be a second place for the timezone to be wrong.
