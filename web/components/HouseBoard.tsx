 * The solo case is the common one on a self-hosted server, and a leaderboard of one is a joke at the
 * owner's expense -- so with a single account the card becomes "you, this week": your face, your count and
 * the covers you finished. A second account turns it into the leaderboard with no other code path.
 *
 * Covers appear for YOUR row only, and only from your own history. `/api/leaderboard` has no per-user
 * scoping, so putting "what they are reading" in it would broadcast every member's current series to
 * everyone on the server with no way to opt out. Faces and counts, exactly as today.
