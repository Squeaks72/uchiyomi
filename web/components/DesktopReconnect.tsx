/**
 * Uchiyomi Desktop's only fallback when it cannot open its own library.
 *
 * The desktop app has no sign-in screen: the window is signed in by the shell (`POST /auth/desktop`, see
 * lib/api.ts), and a lapsed session is exchanged again without anyone seeing it. So `anon` inside the app's
 * window means the exchange ITSELF was refused -- the shell did not hand the page its header, or the server
 * running is not the one this window was opened for. A password form would be a dead end (there is no
 * password), so this says what happened and offers the two things that can fix it: ask again, then restart.
 *
 * Shown only when the preload marker is present (AppShell); a browser tab on the same port gets
 * LoginScreen's "opens in the Uchiyomi app" line instead.
