// Admin → Settings: sections on the settings grid, every row saving on its own.
//
// Fork reorganisation: General · Privacy & access · Updates & schedules · Library housekeeping · Chapters & naming
// (scanlators, source order, notice chapters, borrowed names, group upgrades) · Notifications · Downloads · Downloads &
// politeness · Content ratings. The text below describes how the tab was first built; where it says "Server" read
// "General" plus "Privacy & access", and "18+ filter" is now Content ratings.
//
// Until v0.39.0 this tab was a `.board` of cards of every shape with three save idioms side by side: three
// full-width "Save name" / "Save interval" buttons, switches that saved on their own with a toast, a tiny
// "Save" chip under the cleanup days, and one dirty-tracked button for the scanlator lists -- eleven cards
// with no order to them. It is now Server · Updates & schedules · Library housekeeping · Scanlators, in
// that DOM order (Server first: `test/e2e/run.mjs` reads the first 4000 characters of body text for the
// install-count payload), composed from `components/settings.tsx` so a field saves when you leave it and
// says "Saved" in one place. The only Save button left is the scanlators' one, because those are lists
// that are edited in several steps and must land as one write. Since v0.43.0 a fifth, Notifications
// (components/AdminNotifications.tsx), follows them; its dialog saves a whole target at once. After it, the
// 18+ filter: which genres and sources the "Show 18+" switch hides besides 18+ libraries. Last, the source order:
// which followed source a new chapter is taken from. After that, notice chapters: per series type, whether short
// chapters numbered with a fraction (12.5, with 3 pages or fewer) are hidden -- or, with "Only hide short ones" off
// (v0.55.3, #147), every chapter numbered with one.
//
// Toasts survive on exactly two rows, and only for the sentence the inline tick cannot say: the install count
// ("Thank you — counted" / "No longer counted", because opting out destroys the identifier) and the
// read-chapter cleanup ("Read chapters will be deleted" / "Read chapters are kept", because it deletes
// files). Every other row's outcome is its own state plus the tick.

 * choice the follow order made alone until now, where the source a series was added from won every tie. A
 * series can have its own order, from its Sources & translations sheet, which replaces this one for it.
 *
 * Nothing already downloaded is replaced because of it, and the help says so: #93's switch that re-fetched
 * held chapters from a better-ranked source was not taken (lib/sourcePrefs.ts says why).
 *
 * Held locally and saved whole on every change, re-seeded when the settings refetch, like the genre list
 * above: read straight from `data`, two quick arrows both moved the list as it was before either save
 * landed, and the second quietly undid the first. EVERY STORED ID IS KEPT (lib/sourceOrder.ts): the list of
 * sources is the registry's, which has no extensions while the engine restarts, and #93 saved an order built
 * from it -- one arrow then, and every extension was gone from the order.
 *
 * Arrows rather than dragging: a short list that changes rarely, and two buttons work on a phone, from a
 * keyboard and with a screen reader.
