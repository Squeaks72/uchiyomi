 * The app's on/off toggle.
 *
 * It exists because there were three hand-rolled copies of it and all three positioned the knob with
 * `left-*`. The track mirrors under `dir="rtl"` and a physical `left` does not, so in Arabic every one of
 * them drew "off" exactly where a reader looks for "on" -- a toggle that lies about its own state. The knob
 * is placed with `start-*` here, and there is one copy so a fourth cannot drift.
