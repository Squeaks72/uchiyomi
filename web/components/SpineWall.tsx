 * book, three are a short shelf, twelve are a shelf. A 2x2 mosaic holding one cover looks broken, which is
 * the state a new library spends its first week in.
 *
 * Everything directional is logical (`-ms`, `pe`, an `rtl:` shadow), so under Arabic the shelf stacks from
 * the other edge and still reads newest-in-front instead of tearing open on one side.
