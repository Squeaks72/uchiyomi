/**
 * One saved manga page, rendered as the page itself.
 *
 * **Fixed 2:3 tiles, not masonry.** `/api/bookmarks` carries no page dimensions, so an honest masonry
 * layout would need a second round trip per tile; guessing instead reflows every column the moment the
 * real heights arrive. A fixed ratio is stable on first paint, and 2:3 is already the card ratio, so a
 * grid of moments and a grid of covers line up.
 *
 * **Width 400.** `/img/books/:id/page/:n` caches per width, and every distinct width is a fresh CBZ open
 * plus a sharp resize plus a new cache generation. The app had exactly one page width before this (200,
 * the reader scrubber) and 400 is the width the cards already request, so this adds no new generation for
 * a cover and reuses a warm one wherever a page has been seen at card size.
 *
 * `object-top` because a portrait manga page cropped to 2:3 from the middle reliably lands on the gutter
 * between panels -- the same reason the cover tiles pass it.
