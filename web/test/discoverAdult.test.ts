// Discover's half of the "Show 18+" chip (v0.42.0, issue #64), read from source like wall.test.ts.
//
// The server now hides adult PROVIDERS from Discover's listings, not just 18+ libraries from the library.
// That filter needs an off switch on the one screen it changes, and three client rules make it one rather
// than a trapdoor. None of them can be seen in a unit test of a function, because each is a decision about
// where a component is mounted and what it is mounted with, so each is asserted against the page's text and
// each names the edit that puts the bug back.
//
//  1. The chip must stay mounted while the reveal is ON. `hiddenAdult` is 0 once nothing is hidden, so a
//     chip rendered on `hiddenAdult > 0` alone would vanish the moment it was pressed and strand the
//     session with adult sources showing and no way to hide them again.
//  2. It must be anchored where searching does not unmount it. SourcePicker — the obvious home, it is the
//     chip row — is mounted only while `mode === 'newest'`, and the cross-source search is one of the
//     surfaces the reveal changes.
//  3. The ADMIN console must not inherit the hide. Providers is where a source is tested, unblocked or
//     switched off, and an admin cannot act on a row that is not on the page; on the install this was
//     written against twelve of fourteen sources are adult.
