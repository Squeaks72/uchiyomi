// A repeated page — a scanlator credit page, an advert — used to be REMOVED from the list the reader indexes
// into. That is what made "flat index" and "page number" two different things, and four separate failures all
// grew out of that one gap. None of them were reachable by a test while the arithmetic lived inside an
// 800-line component, which is why this module exists at all.
//
// ⚠️ Every guard below is asserted under `hide` as well as `collapse`. Under `collapse` nothing is removed,
// so all four bugs are impossible by construction and a test that only covered that mode would pass whether
// or not the fix were real.
