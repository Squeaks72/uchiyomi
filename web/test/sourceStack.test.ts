// The owner: "if one is multiple sources it shows once with the icons of the multiple sources". A card used to show
// one source's icon (in Newest, with more than one source on the wall) and a "3 sources" text badge; search showed
// neither. Now every card, in Newest, Popular and search, draws its providers as up to three overlapping icons and a
// "+2" for the rest -- one icon per extension, so MangaDex's languages are one. The arithmetic is lib/sourceGroups.ts
// `iconStack`; the card is rendered to markup here, as actionList.test.ts renders its rows, and the page's wiring is
// read from source like wall.test.ts.
